Ehlo,

it's been a long time since I last blogged. 
I've been a little busy with my ossec/thesis project, so there was barely any time to blog. However, last weekend (Saturday 21st November) I gave a talk about OSSEC integrated into an ELK stack (elasticsearch, logstash, kibana) environment.
Turns out it was a great success, and to anyone who missed it, I put my slides online [here](http://www.aremai.net/files/bsides2015-ossec.pdf)

I strongly recommend you check out the fantastic project on Github that created it. They forked the original OSSEC release and improved it a thousand times and integrated it nicely with ELK.
Please head over [here](https://github.com/wazuh)
and for more information check out their [official website](http://www.wazuh.com)

They're constantly increasing it and I had the pleasure of demonstrating their current release at the bsides.vienna 2015

If you have any questions regarding the talk or ossec/elk just shoot me an email or ping me on jabber.
