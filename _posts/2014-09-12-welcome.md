===why aremai?

recently i got asked about the meaning behind “aremai”. it’s pretty simple. aremai is the _correct_ phonetic expression of RMI, which in turn is an acronym for Remote Method Invocation [for details see this article:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_remote_method_invocation) i like the sound of it and also found it funny how differently people pronounced RMI. 

maybe i have now demystified the name of my domain ;-)
