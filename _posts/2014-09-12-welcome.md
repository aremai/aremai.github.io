### Hi there,

#### why aremai?

<!--more-->

Recently I got asked about the meaning behind “aremai”. It’s pretty simple. <<aremai>> is the _correct_ phonetic expression of RMI, which in turn is an acronym for Remote Method Invocation [for details see this article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_remote_method_invocation). I liked the sound of it and also thought it was funny how people pronounced RMI differently. 

Maybe I have now demystified the name of my domain ;-)
