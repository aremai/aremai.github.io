### long version
my name is theresa. during the day i'm a (unix) sysadmin located in a large-sized data center. during the night i work on various projects for my bachelor degree in computer science. >>> hence always sleep deprived, but mostly in good spirit ;)

within the next weeks, i'll blog about my recent projects that i have been working on. if you do like them or have an idea, then don't hesitate to drop me a line through email or jabber (my jabber id: hellslide@jabber.ccc.de)

i'll mostly blog about security related topics like pci-dss compliance or ossec, but every now and then i'll also write about interesting stuff that i came across on the web.

so watch this space and check back for more updates soon!

thanks for stopping by and have a nice day! ;)
