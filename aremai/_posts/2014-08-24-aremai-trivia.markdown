recently i got asked a lot about the meaning behind "aremai". it's pretty simple.
aremai is the _correct_ phonetic expression of RMI, which in turn is an acronym for Remote Method Invocation (for details see this article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_remote_method_invocation)
i like the sound of it and also found it funny for differently people pronounced RMI.
you could also regard it as a tribute to java ;)

hopefully i've now demystified the name of my domain.
